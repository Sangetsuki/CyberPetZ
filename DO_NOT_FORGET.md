# Digital Creatures List
This are the animals I thought of doing in this project.
This list was generated with the help of [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), so names may change over time.

## 1. Pingufofo: A Fishing Penguin.

## 2. Dinobot: Dinosaur and Robot Fusion (Totally not Agumon).

## 3. Dark Raven.
   - **Inspiration:** Horror Themes (Vampires, Zombies, Frankenstein).

## 5. Dracoblade, the Winged Knight.
  - Basically a dragon knight

## 6. Parrovox (Parrot): Famous Singers Across Different Eras.
  - **Stages:** Childhood: Recent Singers, Adolescence: 90s and 2000s, Adulthood: Older Bands and Singers.
  - A rock n roll parrot would be awesome

## 7. Steampunk Explorer Mole.
- I just think moles are pretty cool animals.

## 8. Pirate Dolphin.

**Upcoming on the List (To Develop):**

## 9. Elephant
## 10. Monkey

Fun fact: Monkeys, parrots, crows, elephants, and dolphins pretend to be irrational to avoid paying taxes.
